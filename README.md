This project was completed for the software engineering course with a team of four programmers. Using Ruby on Rails, we wrote a web app to offer students a platform to collaborate in their studies; the main functionalities of the app were:
<ol>
	<li>Notesharing by university and course</li>
	<li>Creating study groups</li>
	<li>Finding and advertising tutors</li>
</ol>
 
My main contributions to the app included:
<ol>
	<li>CRUD opertaions for users, notes, schools, courses and groups MVCs </li>
	<li>User authorization, including OAuth with Facebook and Google</li>
	<li>Schema design and seeding the DB with filler data for presentation</li>
	<li>Home page carousels advertising groups, tutors etc.</li>
	<li> Other site pages (FAQ, TOS etc.), including setting up a mailer for the Contact Us page</li>
</ol>
